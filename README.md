# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Introduction This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on medical data. The model evaluates patient attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health metrics. Multiple algorithms are implemented and compared to find the most accurate prediction method.
